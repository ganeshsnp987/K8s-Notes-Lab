ðŸ“Œ ConfigMap in Kubernetes
ConfigMap is a Kubernetes object used to store configuration data (key-value pairs) separately from application code.
It allows decoupling configuration from containers, making applications more portable.

ðŸ“Œ Ways to Use ConfigMap
1) As Environment Variables â†’ Inject values into containers.
2) As Command-Line Arguments â†’ Read values at runtime.
3) As a Volume â†’ Mount ConfigMap as files inside a pod.

ðŸ“Œ Summary
As Environment Variables ---> Inject ConfigMap values as env variables (envFrom).
As Command-Line Arguments ---> Use configMapKeyRef to pass values dynamically.
As a Mounted Volume ---> Mount as a file and read values from /etc/config/.

ðŸš€ Benefits
âœ… Centralized config management
âœ… Easy updates without rebuilding images
âœ… Environment-specific configurations
